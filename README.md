Write a Java Servlet Program that represents an authentication platform where user will authenticate their username, password and usercode. After successful authentication make, a will be printed on the screen. All the wrong use of credentials will result in error that you will handle and there will be message also on the screen.   

Following are minimum guidelines:
1. The front end should have a background color and a heading like “User authentication System”.
2. It should have a text field with label ‘username’ where user will enter username, a text field with label ‘password’ where user will enter password, a text field with label usercode where user will enter a usercode and a submit button with label Submit.
3. Initially all text fields will be blank and no color. User enters a wrong username, a message will be printed on the front end “You entered wrong username, please try again”, and the color of the ‘username’ text field will turn red. When a correct username is entered, the color of text field will turn green. This behavior should persist for all text fields. 
4. A successful authentication should be followed by a message on the screen stating that then authentication is successful. 
5. User doesn’t input any value on any of the text fields and clicks the submit button will result as an error and you should handle it. On the front end a message should display “Please enter a username
6. All incorrect entry will result in an error and a message on the front end “You entered wrong …….., please try again. 
8. Database info:
A. Create a database “authSystem”
B. Create a table ‘accountinfo” in that database with the following:
userID		username	password	usercode	
101 		janed 		iamjane	787
